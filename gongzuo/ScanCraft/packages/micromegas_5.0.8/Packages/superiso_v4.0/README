INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://superiso.in2p3.fr

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of several flavour physics observables as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, for the Standard Model and a set of supersymmetric or 2HDM parameters which can be either calculated within this program using the provided interfaces with Isajet, Softsusy, SuSpect, SPheno, NMSSMTools or 2HDMC, or directly supplied by the user thanks to a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA1 or SLHA2) file.

The program has been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc, icc and clang.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf superiso_vX.X.tgz
- cd superiso_vX.X
- in Makefile, first define your C compiler, and the path to Isajet, Softsusy, SPheno, SuSpect, NMSSMTools, or 2HDMC, if you want to use them. If not, you must comment them in the main programs.
- compile with: make

14 main programs are available:
- sm.c: calculation of the observables in the SM
- sm_chi2.c: calculation of the b->sll observables with chi2 evaluation in the SM
- cmssm.c: calculation of the observables for a CMSSM point, linked to isajet, softsusy, spheno or suspect
- amsb.c: calculation of the observables for an AMSB point, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy, spheno or suspect
- hcamsb.c: calculation of the observables for a hypercharged AMSB point, linked to isajet (>=7.80)
- mmamsb.c: calculation of the observables for a mixed moduli AMSB point, linked to isajet (>=7.80)
- gmsb.c: calculation of the observables for a GMSB point, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy, spheno or suspect
- nuhm.c: calculation of the observables for a NUHM point, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy or suspect
- thdm.c: calculation of the observables for a 2HDM type I-IV point, linked to 2HDMC
- slha.c: scan of the user provided SLHA file and calculation of the observables
- slha_chi2.c: calculation of the b->sll observables with chi2 evaluation for a given SLHA file
- cnmssm.c: calculation of the observables for a semi constrained NMSSM point, linked to NMSSMTools
- ngmsb.c: calculation of the observables for a NMSSM GMSB point, linked to NMSSMTools
- nnuhm.c: calculation of the observables for a NMSSM NUHM point, linked to NMSSMTools

They can be compiled with: make name (or make name.c), where "name" stands for sm, cmssm, amsb, gmsb, nuhm, ...

They can be run with: ./name.x
Note that an example SLHA file is also provided: example.lha
